# openscad-carousel

Welcome, traveller!
This tiny repo is a fairly simple [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org) script to generate 3D model of a "traditional" rotating carousel.

Please note that this is **WORK IN PROGRESS**!

Intention is to have a "base model" for 3D printing, that allows to add custom separately created "seats" into the rotating rig space of carousel.

It should be easy to customize resulting model using the constants in the code, described via comments.

Model can and most probably will change extensively in upcoming weeks (summer of 2021).

# usage example

See file `carousel-usage-example.scad` for a simple example on how to use the `carousel.scad` to easily attach own module/object into carousel for testing purposes.

# TODO

Next steps / the plan is to:

- finalize/clean-up the base model
- add auxiliary methods to create a split 3D printable parts easily fittable into standard home printer bed
